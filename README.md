Script which checks availability

For proper work the following steps are needed to be completed:
- in the same folder with the "main.py" create files "constants.py" and "secrets.py", based on the posted files "constants_example.py" and "secrets_example.py".
- Download the chromedriver and put the "chromedriver.exe" file in the folder called Chromedriver, so that the path from "main.py" to "chromedriver.exe"
  looks alike: "/Chromedriver/chromedriver.exe"
- !(BUG)! Be aware, that after the script is terminated, it logs out from all of the devices, which are logged in to your telegram account.
